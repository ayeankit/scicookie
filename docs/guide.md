# Guide

## Build System

There are several build system options available to development of Python
packages. SciCookie support the following:

- [**Poetry**](https://python-poetry.org/) (default): It's a Python package
  manager that streamlines dependency management and package distribution. It
  provides a simple and intuitive syntax for defining project dependencies and
  allows you to easily create and manage virtual environments for your projects.
  With Poetry, you can easily install, update, and remove dependencies, and it
  automatically handles conflicts and resolution between packages. Additionally,
  Poetry provides a comprehensive toolset for packaging and publishing your
  projects to PyPI, including support for building source distributions and
  wheel packages, as well as generating and uploading documentation. Overall,
  Poetry simplifies the development and distribution of Python projects, making
  it a popular tool for many Python developers.

- [**Flit**](https://flit.pypa.io): It's a Python package and a lightweight tool
  for creating and distributing Python packages. It automates the processes
  involved in packaging and submitting a project to PyPI, and provides a
  straightforward interface for managing a project's dependencies. With just a
  few  commands, you can use Flit to quickly create source distributions and
  wheel packages and submit them to PyPI.

The idea behind the options in SciCookie is that you can choose from some of the
most popular system compilers to suit your needs and preferences for developing
Python packages. If you think we should add more options, you can submit your
suggestion as a issue at

## Test Library

There are several test library options available to development of Python packages. SciCookie support the following:

-  [**Pytest**](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.3.x/contents.html): is a powerful property-based testing library for Python. It generates test cases based on properties, uncovering bugs and corner cases. Learn more in the Hypothesis documentation.

- [**Hypothesis**](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/): is a powerful property-based testing library for Python. It generates test cases based on properties, uncovering bugs and corner cases. Learn more in the Hypothesis documentation.
